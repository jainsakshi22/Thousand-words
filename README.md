# Thousand-words
This application will allow you to take pictures using a UIImagePickerController. A UIImagePickerController is a UIViewController that is prebuilt with photo taking capabilities.

Photos will be stored in Albums which will be persisted with Core Data. Core Data allows for more robust data storage.

Itâ€™ll use a CIFilter in order to add cool filters to our photos. This will display these photos using a UICollectionView.Finally, it'll use basic multi-threading with Grand Central Dispatch to dispatch processes asynchronously.
